# Cluster Administration, Installation and Config

1. Manage role-based access control (RBAC)
   - **How to create and manage roles and cluster roles, which define a set of permissions for resources within a namespace or cluster wide.**

     1. step-1 create a role / cluster role.
     2. Cluster Role example.

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: [rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1](http://rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1)
     kind: ClusterRole
     metadata:
      name: pod-reader
     rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
       resources: ["pods"]
       verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
     ```

     iii.  Manage role with commands:

     ```
     kubectl edit
     kubectl delete
     kubectl describe
     kubectl get
     ```
   - **How to create and manage role bindings and cluster role**

     1. Role bindings and cluster role bindings are Kubernetes objects that grant the permissions defined in a role or cluster role to users, groups, or service accounts.
     2. You can use the **`kubectl create rolebinding`** and **`kubectl create clusterrolebinding`** commands to create role bindings and cluster role bindings, respectively.
     3. You can also use YAML files to define the subjects and role references for the role bindings and cluster role bindings.
     4. For example, here is a YAML file that defines a cluster role binding named **`pod-viewer`** that grants the **`pod-reader`** cluster role to the **`pod-viewer`** service account in the **`default`** namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: pod-viewer
     subjects:
     - kind: ServiceAccount
       name: pod-viewer
       namespace: default
     roleRef:
       kind: ClusterRole
       name: pod-reader
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     ```
   - **How to use service accounts, which provide an identity for processes that run in a pod, and how to configure them for pods.**

     1. Service accounts are a type of non-human account that provide an identity for processes that run in a pod, and map to a ServiceAccount object in Kubernetes. Service accounts can be used to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server or external services, and their access can be controlled by role-based access control (RBAC) or other mechanisms.
     2. Create a ServiceAccount object in the Kubernetes API, either using the **`kubectl create serviceaccount`** command or a YAML file. For example, this YAML file creates a service account named **`my-service-account`**
     3. 

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ServiceAccount
     metadata:
       name: my-service-account
     ```

     iv.  Assign a role or cluster role to the service account, either using the **`kubectl create rolebinding`** or **`kubectl create clusterrolebinding`** commands or YAML files. For example, this YAML file grants the **`my-service-account`** the **`view`** cluster role, which allows it to view resources across all namespaces:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: my-service-account-view
     subjects:
     - kind: ServiceAccount
       name: my-service-account
       namespace: default
     roleRef:
       kind: ClusterRole
       name: view
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     ```

     • Specify the service account name in the pod spec, using the **`serviceAccountName`** field. For example, this YAML file creates a pod that uses the **`my-service-account`**

     v.

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: my-pod
     spec:
       serviceAccountName: my-service-account
       containers:
       - name: my-container
         image: my-image
     ```
   - How to use certificate signing requests, which allow you to request a certificate from a signer, such as the Kubernetes API server, and how to approve or deny them.

     1. Certificate signing requests (CSRs) are a way to request a certificate from a signer, such as the Kubernetes API server, and have it approved or denied by an authorized entity. CSRs are useful for obtaining TLS certificates for Kubernetes services or pods that need to communicate securely with each other or with external services.
     2. Create a CSR object in the Kubernetes API, either using the **`kubectl create csr`** command or a YAML file. The CSR object should include a PEM-encoded PKCS#10 signing request in the **`spec.request`** field, and the name of the signer in the **`spec.signerName`** field. For example, this YAML file creates a CSR named **`my-csr`** that requests a certificate from the **`kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`** signer:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
     kind: CertificateSigningRequest
     metadata:
       name: my-csr
     spec:
       request: <base64-encoded PKCS#10 CSR>
       signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
       usages:
       - client auth
     ```

     iii.

     - Submit the CSR object to the Kubernetes API server using the **`kubectl apply`** command. For example:

     `kubectl apply -f my-csr.yaml`

     iv.  Check the status of the CSR using the **`kubectl get csr`** command. The CSR will have  one of the following conditions: **`Pending`**, **`Approved`**, **`Denied`**, or **`Issued`**. For example:

     ```yaml
     kubectl get csr my-csr
     NAME     AGE   SIGNERNAME                            REQUESTOR          CONDITION
     my-csr   1m    kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client   kubernetes-admin   Pending
     ```

     - Approve or deny the CSR using the **`kubectl certificate approve`** or **`kubectl certificate deny`** commands. Only users or groups with the **`certificatesigningrequests/approval`** permission can do this. For example, to approve the CSR:

     `kubectl certificate approve my-csr`

     - If the CSR is approved, the signer will issue a certificate and store it in the **`status.certificate`** field of the CSR object. You can retrieve the certificate using the **`kubectl get csr`** command with the **`o jsonpath`** flag. For example:

     `kubectl get csr my-csr -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}'`

     - Save the certificate to a file and use it for your service or pod. You may also need to save the CA certificate of the signer for verification. You can find the CA certificate in the **`-client-ca-file`** flag of the kube-apiserver, or in the **`ca.crt`** key of the **`kubeconfig`** file.
     - 
   - How to use namespaces, which are logical partitions of a cluster that can have their own RBAC policies and resource quotas.
     1.

     Namespaces are a way to organize and isolate resources within a Kubernetes cluster. You can use namespaces to create different environments for different purposes, such as development, testing, and production. You can also use namespaces to apply different RBAC policies and resource quotas to different groups of users or applications.

     To use namespaces in Kubernetes, you need to follow these steps:

     - Create a namespace object in the Kubernetes API, either using the **`kubectl create namespace`** command or a YAML file. For example, this YAML file creates a namespace named **`my-namespace`**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Namespace
     metadata:
       name: my-namespace
     ```

     - Create resources (pods, services, etc.) in the namespace, either using the **`-namespace`** flag of the **`kubectl`** command or the **`metadata.namespace`** field of the YAML file. For example, this YAML file creates a pod named **`my-pod`** in the **`my-namespace`** namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: my-pod
       namespace: my-namespace
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: my-container
         image: my-image
     ```

     - Apply RBAC policies to the namespace, either using the **`kubectl create role`** and **`kubectl create rolebinding`** commands or YAML files. For example, this YAML file creates a role named **`my-role`** that can get, watch, and list pods in the **`my-namespace`** namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Role
     metadata:
       name: my-role
       namespace: my-namespace
     rules:
     - apiGroups: [""]
       resources: ["pods"]
       verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
     ```

     - Apply resource quotas to the namespace, either using the **`kubectl create quota`** command or a YAML file. For example, this YAML file creates a resource quota named **`my-quota`** that limits the total amount of memory and CPU that can be used by all pods in the **`my-namespace`** namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ResourceQuota
     metadata:
       name: my-quota
       namespace: my-namespace
     spec:
       hard:
         requests.memory: 1Gi
         requests.cpu: 1
         limits.memory: 2Gi
         limits.cpu: 2
     ```
   - How to use pod security policies, which are cluster-level resources that control the security aspects of pods, such as privileged mode, host network, and allowed volumes.
     1.

     Pod security policies are a way to enforce certain security rules for pods in a Kubernetes cluster. They can help you prevent pods from running with excessive privileges, accessing sensitive host resources, or compromising the cluster’s network. [Pod security policies are deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21, and removed in v1.251](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/)[, so you should consider using alternative solutions, such as Pod Security Admission2](https://techblog.cisco.com/blog/understanding-and-applying-kubernetes-pod-security-policy) [or a third-party admission plugin3](https://erictune.github.io/docs/user-guide/pod-security-policy/).

     To use pod security policies in Kubernetes, you need to follow these steps:

     - [Enable the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller in the kube-apiserver, by adding **`-enable-admission-plugins=PodSecurityPolicy`** to the command line arguments4](https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-04/k8s-pod-security-policies/).

     ```yaml
     Create a PodSecurityPolicy object in the Kubernetes API, either using the **kubectl create psp** command or a YAML file. The PodSecurityPolicy object defines a set of rules and restrictions for pods, such as the allowed capabilities, volumes, host network, user IDs, etc. For example, this YAML file creates a pod security policy named **restricted** that only allows pods to run as non-root, non-privileged, and with a limited set of volumes:
     ```

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
     kind: PodSecurityPolicy
     metadata:
       name: restricted
     spec:
       privileged: false
       allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
       runAsUser:
         rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
       seLinux:
         rule: RunAsAny
       supplementalGroups:
         rule: RunAsAny
       fsGroup:
         rule: RunAsAny
       volumes:
       - configMap
       - emptyDir
       - projected
       - secret
       - downwardAPI
       - persistentVolumeClaim
     ```

     - Create a ClusterRole object that grants the **`use`** permission for the pod security policy to a set of users, groups, or service accounts. For example, this YAML file creates a cluster role named **`psp:restricted`** that allows the **`system:serviceaccounts`** group to use the **`restricted`** pod security policy:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRole
     metadata:
       name: psp:restricted
     rules:
     - apiGroups:
       - policy
       resourceNames:
       - restricted
       resources:
       - podsecuritypolicies
       verbs:
       - use
     ```

     - Create a ClusterRoleBinding or a RoleBinding object that binds the cluster role to the subjects. For example, this YAML file creates a cluster role binding named **`default:restricted`** that binds the **`psp:restricted`** cluster role to the **`system:serviceaccounts`** group in the **`default`** namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: default:restricted
     roleRef:
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       kind: ClusterRole
       name: psp:restricted
     subjects:
     - kind: Group
       name: system:serviceaccounts
       namespace: default
     ```

     - Create pods in the cluster that comply with the pod security policy. If a pod does not meet the requirements of the pod security policy, it will be rejected by the admission controller. For example, this YAML file creates a pod named **`nginx`** that runs as non-root, non-privileged, and with an emptyDir volume:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: nginx
       labels:
         app: nginx
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: nginx
         image: nginx
         ports:
         - containerPort: 80
         volumeMounts:
         - mountPath: /cache
           name: cache-volume
       volumes:
       - name: cache-volume
         emptyDir: {}
     ```
   - How to use network policies, which are namespace-level resources that define how pods can communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
     1.

     ```yaml
     Network policies are a way to control the network traffic between pods and other network endpoints in a Kubernetes cluster. They allow you to specify which pods can communicate with each other, and which external services or IP addresses they can access. [Network policies are implemented by the network plugin, so you need to use a networking solution that supports them, such as Calico, Cilium, or Antrea1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).
     ```

     To use network policies, you need to follow these steps:

     - Create a network policy object in the Kubernetes API, either using the **`kubectl create networkpolicy`** command or a YAML file. The network policy object defines a set of rules and selectors for the pods and network endpoints that are allowed or denied to communicate. For example, this YAML file creates a network policy named **`allow-nginx`** that allows pods with the label **`app: nginx`** to receive traffic from pods with the label **`access: true`** in the same namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: NetworkPolicy
     metadata:
       name: allow-nginx
     spec:
       podSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app: nginx
       ingress:
       - from:
         - podSelector:
             matchLabels:
               access: "true"
     ```

     - Apply the network policy object to the Kubernetes cluster using the **`kubectl apply`** command. For example:

     `kubectl apply -f allow-nginx.yaml`

     - Verify that the network policy is working as expected using the **`kubectl describe`** or **`kubectl get`** commands. For example:

     `kubectl describe networkpolicy allow-nginx`
   - How to use audit logs, which are records of requests made to the Kubernetes API server, and how to configure audit policies and backends
     1.

     Audit logs are a way to monitor and troubleshoot the activities and events that occur in a Kubernetes cluster. They can help you identify who, when, where, and how the Kubernetes API server was accessed or modified. They can also help you ensure compliance with security and regulatory standards.

     To use audit logs in Kubernetes, you need to do the following steps:

     - Enable the audit logging feature in the kube-apiserver, by adding the **`-audit-log-path`** flag to specify the log file path. [You can also use other flags to configure the log format, rotation, and retention1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/).
     - Define an audit policy that specifies what events should be logged and how much information they should contain. The audit policy is a YAML file that contains a list of rules with different audit levels and stages. [You can pass the audit policy file to the kube-apiserver using the **`-audit-policy-file`** flag](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/)[2](https://signoz.io/blog/kubernetes-audit-logs/).
     - Choose an audit backend that determines how the audit events are stored and processed. The default audit backend is the log backend, which writes the audit events to a file. [You can also use the webhook backend, which sends the audit events to an external HTTP service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/)[3](https://sysdig.com/learn-cloud-native/kubernetes-security/kubernetes-audit-log/).

# Use Kubeadm to Install a basic cluster

Sure, I can help you with some use cases and practical questions on how to use Kubeadm to install a basic cluster. Kubeadm is a tool that automates the process of creating and managing a Kubernetes cluster. It is useful for testing, creating baselines, and learning Kubernetes concepts. Here are some examples of use cases and questions:

- Use case: You want to create a Kubernetes cluster with one master node and two worker nodes. You have three machines that meet the prerequisites for installing Kubeadm and Kubernetes. How would you use Kubeadm to set up the cluster?

Question: What are the steps to initialize the master node using Kubeadm? What command and flags would you use?

- Answer: To initialize the master node, you need to run the **`kubeadm init`** command with the appropriate flags. For example, you can use the **`-pod-network-cidr`** flag to specify the subnet range for the pod network. You can also use the **`-apiserver-advertise-address`** flag to specify the IP address of the master node. A possible command would be:

`sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.1.100`

- Use case: You want to join a worker node to the cluster that you created with Kubeadm. You have the token and the certificate hash that were generated by the master node. How would you use Kubeadm to join the worker node to the cluster?
- Question: What are the steps to join the worker node using Kubeadm? What command and flags would you use?
- Answer: To join the worker node, you need to run the **`kubeadm join`** command with the appropriate flags. For example, you can use the **`-token`** flag to provide the token, the **`-discovery-token-ca-cert-hash`** flag to provide the certificate hash, and the **`-control-plane-endpoint`** flag to provide the IP address and port of the master node. A possible command would be:

    `sudo kubeadm join --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef --control-plane-endpoint 192.168.1.100:6443`

- Use case: You want to upgrade your cluster to a newer version of Kubernetes using Kubeadm. You have checked the release notes and the upgrade prerequisites. How would you use Kubeadm to upgrade the cluster?
- Question: What are the steps to upgrade the cluster using Kubeadm? What commands and flags would you use?
- Answer: To upgrade the cluster, you need to follow these steps:
  - Upgrade Kubeadm on all nodes using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use:

    **`sudo apt update sudo apt install -y kubeadm`**
  - Upgrade the master node using the **`kubeadm upgrade`** command. For example, to upgrade to version 1.25, you can use:

    **`sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.25.0`**
  - Upgrade the kubelet and kubectl on the master node using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use:

    **`sudo apt install -y kubelet kubectl sudo systemctl restart kubelet`**
  - Upgrade the worker nodes using the **`kubeadm upgrade`** command. For example, to upgrade to version 1.25, you can use:

    **`sudo kubeadm upgrade node`**
  - Upgrade the kubelet and kubectl on the worker nodes using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use:

    **`sudo apt install -y kubelet kubectl sudo systemctl restart kubelet`**
